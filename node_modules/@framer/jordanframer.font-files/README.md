## Overview

This package allows you to use custom font files in your Framer projects on the desktop & web.

This package fixes issues you may see when using **Live Preview** and **Share** links in browsers that don‚Äôt display the font and devices that don‚Äôt natively have that font family.

Supported font file types: `.ttf` `.otf` `.woff` `.woff2` `.eot`

## Usage

#### üíæ Local Font Files

Watch this [screencast video](http://jrdn.io/a3cf6b) on how to use this package with local font files or by following the steps below: 

1. Add the **Loader Component** to the initial frame of your App.

2. Add the **File Component** to your Framer canvas and set these properties:
  * **CSS Name** the browser uses for your font
  * **Font File** to load in the prototype

3. Connect the **File Component** to the **Loader Component** Font Files list in the propety panel.

4. Preview your custom fonts in your App on mobile or desktop devices that typically don‚Äôt have your font using live preview or a share link.


#### üåê CDN font CSS Import

Alternatively, if you have your font CSS on a CDN you can provide the **Loader Component** the URL in as the source as follows:

1. Add the **Loader Component** to the initial frame of your App.

2. In the properties panel of the component select **URL** for the source.

3. Paste in a URL to your font CSS CDN in the **URL** property.

4. Preview your custom fonts in your App on mobile or desktop devices that typically don‚Äôt have your font using live preview or a share link.
